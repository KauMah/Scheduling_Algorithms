# Scheduling Algorithms 

This contains my C implementation of 5 scheduling algorithms as detailed by the book _Operating Systems Concepts, 10th ed_ by Avi Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne

## Chapter 5 - Programming problem at the end + Further challenge #2

If you found this helpful, drop a star on my repo!

Completing this project will require writing the following C files:

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The supporting files invoke the appropriate scheduling algorithm. 

For example, to build the FCFS scheduler, enter

make fcfs

which builds the fcfs executable file.
